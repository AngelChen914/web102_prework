## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app. 
The explanations of the tasks were relatively clear, but the instructions on how to find the secret code were obscure and confusing. Sometimes, I took extra time because some of the instructions of what I needed to do were puzzling. I also gained knowledge through the links provided, and I'm glad that I finished the project. I also struggled making a gif, but I did it in the end.
